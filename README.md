AndrewNgCourse - Self implemented code for this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLop4L2eGk&list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)  
NeuralNetworks - collection of miscellaneous projects  
SystemBoardDetection - Self developed, unique project for detecting components on system board.  
    For top side components(resistor, capasitor...) ThesorFlow API was used.  
    The ssd_inception_v2_coco was retrained with new scrapped and annotated images.  
    For bottom side detection (copper traces) segmentation semantic used.  
    The binary masks were created from sample images using ImageJ tool,  
    Then augmented using Keras ImageDataGenerator and fed into U-Net from data science bowl Kaggle challenge.
